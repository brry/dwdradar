Please always add all authors in the Authors@R field 

Done. They had written me it would be sufficient to keep the note in the src code.
But I agree completely their contributions should be properly included!


2.
Please elaborate in the .Rd files e.g. value of bin2num().
3.
Please add small executable examples in your Rd-files to illustrate the
use of the exported function.

I have decided to not export bin2num() and expanded the examples in readRadarFile().
